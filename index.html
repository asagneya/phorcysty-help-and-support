<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 24 February 2026</p>

<p>  
Welcome to the Help & Support page for Phorcysty. 
This section is designed to help you understand how the app works and assist you in resolving common issues while using its features.</p>


<h2>About Phorcysty</h2>

<p>Phorcysty is an AI-powered color transfer application that allows you to apply color styles between images and videos using server-side processing. The app is designed to make color styling simple, fast, and accessible with just a single click.</p>

<p>Phorcysty supports multiple workflows, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Image to Image color transfer</li>
    <li>Video to Video color transfer</li>
    <li>Image to Video color transfer</li>
    <li>Video to Image color transfer</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to color style transfer, Phorcysty also provides color enhancement tools that allow you to adjust and refine your results, such as Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Hue, Temperature, and Tint.</p>

<p>All processing is performed through secure AI-powered systems to deliver consistent results while preserving the original structure and visual quality of your media.</p>


  <h2>How to Use Phorcysty</h2>


<p>Select a source image or video from your device (from which the color style will be taken).</p>

<p>Select the target image or video (on which the color style will be applied).</p>

<p>Tap the Process button to start AI-powered color transfer.</p>

<p>Wait while your media is securely processed on the server.</p>

<p>After processing, you can fine-tune the result using the color enhancement tools such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Brightness</li>
    <li>Contrast</li>
    <li>Saturation</li>
    <li>Hue</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
    <li>Tint</li>
</ul>



<p>Use the Undo and Redo buttons to revert or reapply changes while editing.</p>

<p>Once you are satisfied with the result, tap Download to save the final output to your device.</p>


<h2>Internet Requirement</h2>


<p>Phorcysty uses AI-powered server-side processing to deliver high-quality color transfer, color style transformation, and color enhancement results. An active internet connection is required to upload selected media files to the server and receive the processed output.</p>

<p>AI-based features of the app cannot function without an internet connection.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Phorcysty requires access to your device’s media storage so that you can select images and videos for color transfer and editing.</p>

<p>Internet permission is required to securely upload selected media files for AI-powered server-side processing and to receive the processed results.</p>


<h2>Saving Results</h2>


<p>Once processing is complete, you can download the final image or video directly to your device using the Download button.</p>

<p>Downloaded files are saved to your device’s local storage and are accessible from your gallery or file manager. The app does not automatically share your media with any third party.</p>

<p>You have full control over your downloaded content, and you may delete it from your device at any time.</p>


<h2>Common Issues & Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Processing takes more time than usual</strong><br>
Processing time depends on file size, video length, and your internet speed. Larger files or longer videos may take a few extra seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Slow or no response from the app</strong><br>
Please make sure you have a stable and active internet connection. Server-side AI processing requires a good network connection.</li>

<li><strong>Large images take time to load</strong><br>
High-resolution images may take a moment to load on the editing screen. This is normal behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Download button not responding</strong><br>
Wait until processing is fully completed. Try again once the result is displayed.</li>

<li><strong>App feels slow or laggy</strong><br>
Close other background apps and ensure your device has enough free storage and memory.</li>

<li><strong>Output quality not as expected</strong><br>
Results depend on the quality, lighting, and colors of the source and target media. Try using clearer images or videos for better results.</li>

<li><strong>Video processing takes longer than images</strong><br>
Videos are larger in size and require more server resources, so they naturally take more time to process.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the issue continues, please restart the app and check your internet connection.
